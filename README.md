<p> The following are some factors that delayed the Italian unification 

---

Factors That Delayed Italian Unification (5)
<p style="text-align:left;">
<strong>1.Political Fragmentation of Italy: </strong> Italy was divided into many independent 
states (such as Piedmont, Lombardy,  Venice, Papal States, and the Kingdom of the Two 
Sicilies), each with its own rulers and interests, making unity difficult.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<strong>2. Foreign Domination:</strong> <em>Especially Austria</em>
Austria controlled large parts of northern Italy and strongly opposed unification, using 
military power to suppress nationalist movements.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<strong>3.Lack of Strong Leadership Initially: </strong>
Before leaders like Cavour and Victor Emmanuel II emerged, there was no effective leadership to 
coordinate unification efforts.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<strong>4.Opposition from the Catholic Church: </strong>
The Pope ruled the Papal States and opposed unification, fearing the loss of his political power 
and influence.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<strong>5. Economic and Social Differences</strong>
   Italy had major economic and social differences between regions, <em>especially between the industrial 
   North and the agricultural South,</em> which slowed unity.
